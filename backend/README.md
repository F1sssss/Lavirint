### Running the server 

To run server for development/testing run command: 

    make run

To run the server as background process run command:

    make run-background

On server startup the process PID is saved in a file. Location of PID file is specified in `PIDFILE_PATH` environment variable. If PID file already exists the  

To stop the server run command:

    make stop

Shutdown should be initiated with SIGTERM or SIGINT signals. When shutting down, the server closes all connections resulting in '503 Service Unavaliable' responses to clients. However, server will wait for all active requests' workload to finish, but after a timeout it will forcibly close all threads regardless of the remaning workload. Timeout is specified in seconds in `SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` environment variable 

### Commands

Stopping the server gracefully:
    
    make stop

## Locking operations

All endpoints that deal with fiscalisation must be wrapped in the following context to ensure that the invoice numbers are kept in a correct sequence:

```python
import backend.opb.faktura_opb

payment_device_id = '...'

with faktura_opb.invoice_processing_lock(payment_device_id):
    # ...
    pass
```

Locking is based on database row-lock in the table `payment_device_lock`.
